# 👋 Hi, I’m Kareem Zahra

🎓 **Software Engineer | AI & Data Specialist | Digital Innovator**

I’m a Software Engineer specializing in **Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, and Digital Transformation**. With a background in dentistry and advanced education in software engineering and AI, I bring a uniquely multidisciplinary lens to problem-solving—bridging technical depth with healthcare, education, and real-world system optimization.

🔬 I’ve worked with **WIMTACH** on applied AI research projects in the healthcare domain, including ECG-based blood pressure prediction using deep learning. I also led Agile ceremonies, developed user stories, and contributed to model optimization and deployment.

🦷 In my current role as a **Dental Practice Systems Coordinator**, I manage IT infrastructure across 6+ operatories—optimizing clinical software (OPES, VixWin, 3Shape TRIOS), automating workflows with Python/Tkinter, and supporting seamless patient and data operations.

📺 Outside the clinic, I co-manage two educational YouTube channels:  
- [SmileyGlent](https://www.youtube.com/@SmileyGlent) — STEM content for kids  
- [ThinkGlent](https://www.youtube.com/@ThinkGlent) — AI and data science topics for curious minds  
I handle end-to-end content production, scripting, editing, SEO, and analytics.
