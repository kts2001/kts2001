**My name is Kareem Zahra. I am a Software Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, a research assistant with hands-on experience in academic and industry projects, and a digital content creator managing two educational YouTube channels. I worked with WIMTACH, contributing to research initiatives by defining project goals, writing user stories, and managing technical collaborations. My academic, technical, and content creation experiences have shaped my problem-solving skills, data-driven thinking, and adaptability across digital platforms.**
